# üêù solo2 library and CLI

The Solo 2 device can operate in one of two modes (USB VID:PID in brackets):
- regular (Solo 2) mode ([1209:BEEE][beee-pid])
- maintenance (LPC 55) mode ([1209:B000][b000-pid])

In regular mode, the PCSC or CTAP interface is used opportunistically.  
In maintenance mode, NXP's custom HID protocol is used (via [`lpc55-host`][lpc55-host]).

On Linux, maintenance mode needs [udev rules][udev-rules].

You can switch to LPC 55 mode using `solo2 app admin maintenance`  
You can switch to Solo 2 mode using `solo2 bootloader reboot` (or by replugging the device).

Solo 2 is supported by Ludovic Rousseau's [CCID][solokeys-ccid] driver since release 1.4.35 (July 25, 2021).  
Unfortunately, Debian and macOS have not updated yet.

The included [Info.plist](Info.plist) works.

### ‚ö† DANGER ‚ö†

If the firmware is invalid according to the bootloader, the device always stays in bootloader mode. This is OK.

**BUT**: If the firmware is valid according to the bootloader, and the device boots into it, but the firmware has issues
(e.g., panics), the only way to get back into bootloader mode and flash a new firmware is by attaching a debugger.

This is quite fiddly, and needs a [special cable][tag-connect].
We recommend using NXP's [development board][dev-board] instead.

### Installation

```
cargo install solo2
```

For experimental "PKI lite" support, use `cargo install --features dev-pki solo2`.
This is not intended to and will not grow into full PKI creation + management functionality,
the goal is only to enable developing and testing all functionality of all official apps.

### Examples

If the key is in regular mode, and its firmware contains the admin app:
- `solo2 app admin uuid` reads out the serial number.
- `solo2 app admin maintenance` switches to bootloader mode.

If the key is in regular mode, and its firmware contains the NDEF app:
- `solo2 app ndef capabilities` reads out the NDEF capabilities.

If the key is in maintenance mode:
- `solo2 bootloader reboot` switches to regular mode (if the firmware is valid).

Note that subcommands are inferred, so e.g. `solo2 b r` works like `solo2 bootloader reboot`.


### Logging

Uses [`pretty_env_logger`][pretty-env-logger], configured via `--verbose` flags.
For instance, `-v` logs INFO and `-vv` logs `DEBUG` level logs.
